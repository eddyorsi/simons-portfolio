# simons-portfolio
Some projects I have done at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics. 
Involves cross different files, inputting information into a database, updating google sheets and using OCR to extract textual information.
The ArXiv scraper is in somewhat of an unfinished state. It has not been implemented into an UI and so is only usable in its code form by me. The GUI file is a culmination of the HRlog file and the invite list file along with some added features such as cross referencing Danfords and Hilton invite lists with our records.
